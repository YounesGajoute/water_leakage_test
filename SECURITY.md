## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### Industrial Control System Security

#### Network Security
- **Air Gap**: Consider air-gapping critical systems from external networks
- **Firewall**: Implement proper firewall rules
- **VPN**: Use VPN for remote access
- **Network Segmentation**: Separate control networks from business networks

#### Access Control
- **Authentication**: Use strong authentication mechanisms
- **Authorization**: Implement role-based access control
- **Session Management**: Proper session timeout and management
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit trails

#### Physical Security
- **Physical Access**: Restrict physical access to hardware
- **Tamper Detection**: Implement tamper detection mechanisms
- **Environmental Controls**: Secure environmental conditions

### Application Security

#### Input Validation
- **Sanitization**: Validate and sanitize all inputs
- **Boundary Checking**: Check all numerical boundaries
- **Type Safety**: Use type hints and validation

#### Error Handling
- **Secure Error Messages**: Don't expose sensitive information
- **Graceful Degradation**: Handle errors gracefully
- **Logging**: Log security-relevant events

#### Data Protection
- **Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- **Key Management**: Proper key management practices
- **Data Minimization**: Collect only necessary data

### Hardware Security

#### GPIO Security
- **Pin Protection**: Protect GPIO pins from unauthorized access
- **Signal Validation**: Validate all hardware signals
- **Fault Detection**: Detect hardware faults and anomalies

#### Sensor Security
- **Calibration**: Regular sensor calibration
- **Tamper Detection**: Detect sensor tampering
- **Data Integrity**: Ensure sensor data integrity

## 🔍 Security Testing

### Automated Security Testing

We use automated security testing tools:

```bash
# Security scanning
bandit -r . -f json -o security-report.json
safety check

# Dependency vulnerability scanning
pip-audit

# Code quality and security
flake8 --select=security
```

### Manual Security Testing

- **Penetration Testing**: Regular penetration testing
- **Code Review**: Security-focused code reviews
- **Threat Modeling**: Regular threat modeling exercises
- **Hardware Testing**: Physical security testing

### Security Checklist
