# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
conduct@techmac.com.
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series
of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or
permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior,  harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within
the community.

## Safety Considerations for Industrial Applications

Given that this is an industrial control system application, we have additional
considerations for safety and professionalism:

### Safety-First Communication

* Always prioritize safety in discussions and contributions
* Report safety concerns immediately and privately
* Be extra careful when discussing hardware modifications or safety systems
* Verify safety implications before suggesting changes to safety-critical code

### Professional Standards

* Maintain professional communication standards appropriate for industrial software
* Be especially thorough in code reviews for safety-critical components
* Follow established industrial safety protocols and standards
* Respect the serious nature of industrial control systems

### Technical Accuracy

* Ensure all technical discussions are accurate and well-researched
* Be clear about the difference between development/testing and production use
* Include appropriate safety warnings when discussing hardware modifications
* Verify technical claims before making them

## Reporting Guidelines

If you believe someone is violating the Code of Conduct, we ask that you report
it by emailing conduct@techmac.com. All reports will be kept confidential.

In your report please include:

* Your contact information for follow-up contact
* Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved
* Description of what occurred
* Description of the context around the incident
* Any additional context that may be helpful
* If you believe this incident is ongoing
* If there is a publicly available record (e.g. a mailing list archive or a public IRC logger)
* Any additional information that may be helpful

After filing a report, a representative will contact you personally, review the
incident, follow up with any additional questions, and make a decision as to how
to respond. If the person who is harassing you is part of the response team, they
will recuse themselves from handling your incident. If the complaint originates
from a member of the response team, it will be handled by a different member of
the response team. We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of
protecting victims of abuse.

## Addressing Grievances

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of
Conduct, you should notify conduct@techmac.com with a concise description of your
grievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our existing
governing policies.
